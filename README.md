# caesar_cipher
A Caesar cipher is a primitive encryption tool used by Julius Caesar to protect his military correspondence. 
By shifting the alphabet by a predetermined number of positions, a message becomes scrambled.\
\
Suppose Caesar wants to send his Legatus the following message: "attackatdawn".
And he and his Legatus agreed on shifting down the alphabet by 3 letters.
He would write the message as such: "dwwdfndwgdzq". 
The Legatus can simply shift up by 3 letters to reveal the original message: "attackatdawn".
This method was often enough to fool his unwitting enemies.
